# RevCycleMGMT Claims Pipeline

Synthetic, local-first reference pipeline for startup-practice revenue cycle workflows: 837 claim intake, 999/277CA clearinghouse acknowledgments, 835 remittance reconciliation, CARC/RARC denial patterns, and dashboard-ready RCM metrics.

This repository is designed as a public RevCycleMGMT portfolio proof. It shows how a clinician founder's first revenue operating layer can be organized without using production claims, patient records, PHI, payer credentials, or clearinghouse credentials.

---

## Highlights
- EDI/X12 scope: 837P/837I/835/999/277CA, with planned hooks for 270/271 and 276/277.
- Clearinghouse visibility: acknowledgement tracking, route timing, and payer-response monitoring.
- Revenue cycle model: `claims_header`, `claims_line`, `adjudication`, `payments`, `acknowledgments`, `claim_status`, and `kpi_daily`.
- Denial intelligence: CARC/RARC fields mapped into follow-up-ready records.
- Dashboard starter: claim volume, billed/allowed/paid amounts, remits, acknowledgments, denial rate, payment variance, and claim workqueue export.
- Secure ingress: SFTP, S3, Azure Blob, and BigQuery onboarding runbooks with evidence templates.
- Interoperability bridge: synthetic HL7 PID helper for claim-prep context, masked by default for demo safety.
- Traceability: deterministic hashes connect synthetic raw X12 snapshots to normalized rows.
- Startup launch scenario: one paid claim, one clearinghouse rejection, and one denial/remit follow-up path.
- Safety boundary: demo data only; no PHI, credentials, production claims, or customer data.

## Quickstart (local demo)
```bash
# 1) Create & activate a venv
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2) Install minimal deps
pip install -e .

# 3) Run the demo ETL on sample files
python -m revcyclemgmt_claims.pipelines.ingest_edi --inbox tests/sample_data --warehouse warehouse
python -m revcyclemgmt_claims.pipelines.build_marts --warehouse warehouse

# 4) Launch the dashboard
streamlit run apps/dashboard/rcm_app.py
```

The demo parser recognizes the sample 837, 835, 999, and 277CA-style files and emits synthetic normalized records. The current launch scenario demonstrates three different outcomes:

1. `CLM-LAUNCH-001` moves cleanly from 837 to 999/277CA to 835 payment visibility.
2. `CLM-LAUNCH-002` is rejected at the 277CA stage and routes to clearinghouse follow-up.
3. `CLM-LAUNCH-003` reaches the remit stage but is denied with CARC 16 and routes to denial follow-up.

Real production use would replace the adapter in `parsers/` with a validated X12 translator such as `pyx12`, Bots, or an enterprise EDI parser.

## What This Proves

For a non-technical buyer, this demo proves the operating model:

1. Claim-related X12 files land in a controlled inbox.
2. The pipeline saves a raw copy for traceability.
3. The parser converts the files into clean operational tables.
4. Acknowledgments, remits, payments, and denial signals are linked into one claim journey.
5. A dashboard can show which claims are paid, rejected, denied, waiting, or ready for follow-up.
6. Intake runbooks show how a real engagement would be controlled before any production file is accepted.

That is the RevCycleMGMT portfolio story: make the claims pipeline easier to see, control, and improve.

## Environment
Copy `config/.env.example` to `.env` only for local experiments. Do not commit `.env`. The demo does not require secrets.

---

## Operational Safeguards

This scaffold is healthcare-aware but is not a compliance certification, legal opinion, clearinghouse certification, or payer companion-guide implementation. See `docs/02-governance/operational-safeguards.md` and `SECURITY.md`.

Production use would require formal security review, BAAs where appropriate, payer/clearinghouse companion-guide validation, access controls, monitoring, retention rules, incident response, and no PHI in logs.

---

## Roadmap
- Production-ready adapters for pyx12, Bots, or an enterprise EDI parser
- Eligibility (270/271) and status (276/277) enrichment joins
- Human-reviewed claim edit and denial follow-up workqueues
- Payer companion-guide drift checks
- Prior authorization joins and payer lag benchmarking
- Claim status workqueue filters for accepted, paid, denied, and waiting-for-remit claims
- Dashboard screenshots and hosted synthetic demo walkthrough
- Separate RevCycleMGMT-branded portfolio repositories for 835 reconciliation, acknowledgment monitoring, denial taxonomy, eligibility cache, and capability statement examples
- See `docs/06-portfolio/edi-x12-implementation-roadmap.md` for the proposed EDI/X12 implementation portfolio, including Optum-style clearinghouse API adapter planning.
